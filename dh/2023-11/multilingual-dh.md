## multilinguality as the human condition

>Indigenous peoples have the right to revitalize, use, develop and transmit to future generations their histories, languages, oral traditions, philosophies, writing systems and literatures, and to designate and retain their own names for communities, places and persons.

<cite>[@UNDRIP2007, §13]<cite>

::: notes

The human condition, historically, is one of multilinguality. People speak different languages, dialects, sociolects etc. in different contexts: at home, at work, at social gatherings, for worship etc.. Sometimes we share a language with people across geographic distances, just as in this meeting, and sometimes, we do not understand our direct neighbours.

# Main Challenges
## monolingualism of the infrastructures of the digital

>HTML elements all have names that only use ASCII alphanumerics

## Linguistic imperialism of the episteme of the digital


>'Linguistic imperialism' is shorthand for a multitude of activities, ideologies, and structural relationships. Linguistic imperialism takes place within an overarching structure of asymmetrical North/ South relations, where language interlocks with other dimensions, cultural (particularly in education, science, and the media), economic and political

<cite>[@Phillipson1997RealitiesAndMyths, 239]</cite>

>The basis for the codes, languages, methodologies, and technical instruments of the digital humanities is English; the written and spoken language of all the main conferences, the most prestigious journals, the institutions that control the discipline, the organizations and international consortia, and the central authorities of knowledge is, with few exceptions, some dialect of British or American English.

<cite>[@Fiormonte+2021+TaxationagainstOverrepresentation, 334-335]</cite>

- UNDRIP: United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.
- this  ties back to the map I showed you at the very beginning

::: notes

- these distributions illustrate the gaps shown before
- access to infrastructures of the digital is limited in the Arabic world
- support for Arabic is limited in the digital
- I should also show a map of migrations showing the massive exodus from the Arabic speaking regions of the world
    + significant brain drain contributes to these absences

# Best practices
## Minimal computing

>minimal computing connotes digital humanities work undertaken in the context of some set of constraints. This could include lack of access to hardware or software, network capacity, technical education, or even a reliable power grid

<cite>[@RisamGil2022Introduction, §3]</cite>

>this implies learning how to produce, disseminate, and preserve digital scholarship ourselves, **without the help we can’t get**, even as we fight to build the infrastructures we need at the intersection of, with, and beyond institutional libraries and schools.

<cite>[@Gil+2016, 29]</cite>


::: notes

- minimal computing is a result of GO::DH and events and conditions in Cuba
- Alex Gil's ideas resonated with me, upon meeting in Beirut in April 2015

## *minimal* computing?

<!-- add images -->

::: columns
:::: column

### from a position of privilege

- minimalism as an end in itself
    + destroying resources already at hand
    + fashion
    + purist principles

![Screenshot of a [website](https://bulthaup.com/en/b3/) selling luxury kitchens](../../assets/dh/bulthaupt.png){#fig:bulthaupt}

::::
:::: column

### from a position of exclusion

- minimalism as a means to an end
    + balance our needs against the resources at hand
    + acknowledge the inevitable impact of our actions
    + minimal computing as *meaningful* computing

::: notes

1. minimalism as an end
    - resource-intensive
    - example: Mary Condo
    - example: purist computing infrastructures
        + you got to run your own server and never use evil platforms
2. minimalism as a means to an end 
    + meaningful connectivity
    + original Bauhaus / modernist design:
        * form follows function to 
            - decrease the cost of industrial production
            - increase the material benefits of the expended resources

:::

## minimal *computing*?

::: columns
:::: column

- use what we already know
- use what we can afford long-term
- do not impose unnecessary costs on our users
- do not waste resources to the detriment of our planet

::::
:::: column

- learn techniques new to us
- develop skills
- grow communities: let us come together across languages and scripts at DH2024

::::
:::


::: notes

- first column
    + proven technologies and established standards
    + not the latest framework
        * think of what we do as space travel: Voyager I and II are still functioning with rudimentary computing powers
    + flat technology stacks
    + nothing shiny
