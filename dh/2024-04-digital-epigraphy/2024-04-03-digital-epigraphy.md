# Digital history <br/>what is it and why does it matter?
## Datafication and the epoch of computationability

**Datafication** emphasises the epistemic shift from a world were data were a closely defined part of the output of research processes towards the new status quo in which all research processes are always already computationally mediated through information and communication technologies.

## Data, data everywhere

What exactly to we mean by data?

### All data is modelled

>[Datafication/modeling] is the work of abstracting discrete values from a phenomenon or artifact. These values may be expressed in numbers or texts and are necessarily a reduction of complex materials into a form for computation. With data we can automate processes

## To make sense of *datafication* we need cultural change within the discipline

::: columns
:::: column

### Staus quo

- very little computational research
- limited understanding of the epistemoloigcal and ontological dimentions of **datafication**
- limited understanding of the concept of **research data** and their enourmous potential for historical research  
- limited practical computational skills
- constantly and rapidly evolving environment -> AI
- resentment towards "the digital"

::::
:::: column

### Aims

- Establish a robust and sustainable **data culture** in order to 
    - make sense of the new episteme
    - develop the necessary skills to conduct historical research
    - negotiate new understandings of history as a discipline

## Data culture

::: columns
:::: column

### broad sense

Data culture as a disciplinary culture, in which (research) data and computational methods form an integral part of historical research and reasoning.

This requires:

- fundamental theoretical, epistemological, and ontological knowledge of *datafication*
- reflection on its implications for all parts of the research process
- ongoing discussion on the necessary changes within the discipline

::::
:::: column

### narrow sense

Data culture as quotidian practices, skill sets, and disciplinary protocolls for handling (research) data and computational research.

This requires:

- orientation
- training
- support

::: notes

- broad:
    - (research) data cannot, anymore, be perceived as an appendix / addendum to the "actual" research process
- narrow
    - orientation: guidelines, best practices, white papers
        - through and by example
    - training: across the board
    - support: technical, ethical, judicial
