It evaluates the methodological and practical challenges of digital history as rooted in the socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North when applied to the Global South. It does so using a case study of four Arabic journals from Baghdad, Beirut, Cairo, and Damascus. After outlining the need for building a corpus and the challenges presented by this effort, this article explores a digital corpus of a total of circa 2.65 million words through (social) network analysis and stylometric authorship attribution.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces and evaluates the project Open Arabic Periodical Editions (OpenArabicPE) as a case study of minimal computing. It confronts hyperbolic promises of mass digitization and computational methods for the exploration of digitized cultural heritage as a hegemonic episteme rooted in 20th-century, English-speaking, neoliberal capitalism from the margins. OpenArabicPE is a framework for open, collaborative, and scholarly digital editions of early Arabic periodicals from the late Ottoman Eastern Mediterranean. It addresses the specific affordances of a historical multilingual society, whose material heritage continues to be looted, destroyed, and neglected; whose material heritage resists digitization efforts by being dependent on non-Latin scripts and, for instance, non-Gregorian calendars; and whose contemporary heirs cannot draw on the vast resources in wealth and socio-technical infrastructures of the Global North. Centered around generosity and minimal computing, OpenArabicPE is run by volunteers and currently hosts six editions with some 630 journal issues and more than 7 million words, without any funding, by re-purposing data, software, and infrastructures.},

  abstract = {From the mid-nineteenth century onward, Arabic periodicals were the first mass-medium of South West Asia and North Africa (SWANA) and formed an increasingly globalised public sphere. Consequently, they attract increasingly scholarly attention. However, most articles up until at least World War I were published without a proper byline, commonly causing scholars to conflate owners-cum-editors with their journals. This paper computationally addresses the question of authorship through stylometric authorship attribution applied to data sets derived from digital corpora of journals published in Baghdad (Lughat al-ʿArab), Cairo (al-Zuhūr, alMuqtabas), and Damascus (al-Muqtabas, al-Ḥaqāʾiq) between 1906 and 1918. It demonstrates, firstly, that titles were stylistically sufficiently different to identify a distinctive authorial voice for each periodical. Secondly, it shows that individual anonymous articles cannot be reduced to a single author for each journal and that ownerscum-editors should not be considered strong candidates for their authorship. Thirdly, it also rejects owners-cumeditors as strong candidates for the bulk of anonymous texts originally published in short chunks as part of news sections, announcements, miscellanea etc. Finally, this paper rejects all known authors in our corpus as potential editors thus necessitating further, non-computational research.},
